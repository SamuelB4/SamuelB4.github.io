        <p id="actScene3">Lady Macbeth suffers none of her husband‚Äôs uncertainty. She desires the kingship for him and wants him to murder Duncan in order to obtain it. When Macbeth arrives at Inverness, she overrides all of her husband‚Äôs objections and persuades him to kill the king that very night. He and Lady Macbeth plan to get Duncan‚Äôs two chamberlains drunk so they will black out; the next morning they will blame the murder on the chamberlains, who will be defenseless, as they will remember nothing. While Duncan is asleep, Macbeth stabs him, despite his doubts and a number of supernatural portents, including a vision of a bloody dagger. When Duncan‚Äôs death is discovered the next morning, Macbeth kills the chamberlains‚Äîostensibly out of rage at their crime‚Äîand easily assumes the kingship. Duncan‚Äôs sons Malcolm and Donalbain flee to England and Ireland, respectively, fearing that whoever killed Duncan desires their demise as well.</p>

        <h2 id="anInspectorCalls">An Inspector Calls Summary - Part 1. (Act 1)</h2>
        <p id="inspectorCalls1">An Inspector Calls is a play in three acts, set in Brumley, an English manufacturing town, in 1912. Arthur Birling has convened a dinner for the engagement of his daughter, Sheila, to her boyfriend, Gerald Croft. Arthur and his wife Sybil seem happy, although Sybil is reserved at the meal...</p>

        <h2 id="anInspectorCalls">An Inspector Calls Summary - Part 2. (Act 2)</h2>
        <p id="inspectorCalls1">Act Two begins with the same set. The Inspector questions Gerald about Daisy Renton, and Gerald admits to the affair in front of Sheila and her parents, Arthur and Sybil. Gerald is embarrassed by his indiscretion, but insists his concern for Daisy was authentic. Sheila wonders if she can forgive Gerald enough to continue their relationship. Gerald tells the Inspector he is going to leave for a walk.</p>
        <p id="inspectorCalls2">The Inspector moves on to Sybil, who, on being questioned, says that she, as director of a charity, refused assistance to a pregnant woman. The Inspector tells them that the girl Sybil turned away was Eva Smith, or, as Gerald knew her, Daisy Renton. The Inspector also says that Gerald was not the one who got Eva pregnant. Sybil says she feels no regret, as Eva/Daisy had claimed she was pregnant but was not married to the child‚Äôs father. To this, Sybil responded that Eva/Daisy should ask the child‚Äôs father for money. Sybil blames the unnamed father for the situation, and for Eva/Daisy‚Äôs suicide. Sheila and Arthur tell Sybil to stop talking. In this moment, Sybil realizes that her son, Eric, must be the father of the child, since Eva/Daisy presented herself to the charity as ‚ÄúMrs. Birling.‚Äù Eric returns to the room. Act Two ends.</p>

        <p id="christmasCarol2">He wakes moments before the arrival of the Ghost of Christmas Past, a strange childlike phantom with a brightly glowing head. The spirit escorts Scrooge on a journey into the past to previous Christmases from the curmudgeon's earlier years. Invisible to those he watches, Scrooge revisits his childhood school days, his apprenticeship with a jolly merchant named Fezziwig, and his engagement to Belle, a woman who leaves Scrooge because his lust for money eclipses his ability to love another. Scrooge, deeply moved, sheds tears of regret before the phantom returns him to his bed.</p>
